# SVM
Machine Learning Support Vector Machine Implementation

## Introduction
Several SVM algorithms are implemented in this project

## Problems
1. Solve Primal problem with stochastic gradient update
2. Solve Dual problem with stochastic online update
3. Implement kernelised SVM (Linear, Polynomial, RBF kernels)
4. Implement Sequential Minimal Optimization, a training algorithm for the soft-margin SVM

## How to run
Simply run the jupyter notebook. Make sure using the correct environment. For detailed instructions please see the pdf file.
